# Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python Learning Journey repository! This is a collection of Python codes and problems that I’ve worked on as I learn Python, guided by the YouTube channel [Code with Harry](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithHarry). His tutorials have been incredibly clear and comprehensive, making it possible for me to grasp the fundamentals of programming.

I’m currently following his [Python course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrsmFxEIp5k), which contains 13 chapters. Each chapter includes a practice set with 5-6 problems related to the concepts learned, and the course also features two major projects: 1) Jarvis and 2) Auto-reply AI Chatbot. I am currently on Chapter 4.

This repository serves as a record of my progress and aims to help others who are on a similar path. I’m deeply grateful for the knowledge and skills I’ve gained through his content. If this journey leads me to a job or any significant milestone, I will be extremely grateful to Code with Harry for his invaluable guidance.

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!
